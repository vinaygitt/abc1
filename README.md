# Mini CRM Application
This is a Mini CRM (Customer Relationship Management) Application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The application provides features for ingesting customer and order data, creating audiences based on rules, sending campaigns to the defined audiences, and tracking campaign delivery statuses.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: APIs for ingesting customer and order data into the database.
- **Audience Creation**: A web application where users can create audiences based on rules such as total spend, number of visits, and last visit date. Users can combine multiple rules using AND/OR operators and check the audience size before saving.
- **Campaign Management**: Users can send personalized campaigns to the created audiences and track the delivery statuses (sent or failed) of the campaigns.
- **Google Authentication**: Users can authenticate using their Google accounts to access the application.
- **Scalability and Performance Optimizations**: The application implements a pub/sub model using a message broker  for data ingestion and delivery receipt updates. It also supports batch processing for database operations to improve performance.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ
